## 🧠 Architecture

The app follows a layered structure:

* **Domain Layer** → Expense model + validation
* **State Layer** → Reducer + Context
* **UI Layer** → Modular components
* **Persistence Layer** → LocalStorage abstraction

All business logic lives inside the reducer and selectors, keeping components clean and declarative.

## 💾 Data Storage

Expenses are stored in `localStorage` using a versioned schema:

```
expense-tracker:v1
```

Amounts are stored as integer cents to avoid floating-point precision issues.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. App initializes and loads expenses from localStorage.
2. Reducer manages all state transitions.
3. Selectors compute filtered/sorted views.
4. Modal handles Add/Edit operations.
5. State updates automatically persist to localStorage.
